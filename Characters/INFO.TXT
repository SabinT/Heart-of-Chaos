The anim frame sequence is constructed from images already loaded in memory
(in an array of surfaces).
So the loader function must be passed that array as a parameter whose sprites
are accessed as array[spriteno], which is given in the adf file.
This way the same images can be used for multiple animations or the same image
more than once in the same animation;

The files in a single folder named as ordered numbers are fed in to the sprite array
